# MapTiler samples
Please create a folder per article or usecase in the product's folder. The website has an autobuild to https://labs.maptiler.com/samples/

> When autobuild finished, samples can be found on `https://labs.maptiler.com/samples/[sample path]/`, for example the sample in the `cloud/choropleth-map-basic` folder will end up in [`https://labs.maptiler.com/samples/cloud/choropleth-map-basic/`](https://labs.maptiler.com/samples/cloud/choropleth-map-basic/)

# Public code

This repository is now _private_, but it will be **PUBLIC** at the end of the sprint, when all codes are finished. Do not hesitate to use the link to your folder in the final article as it is.

# Links

# Where to store data for samples
All data and maps need to be stored in one account in MapTiler Cloud. The account is called [**MapTiler Web**](https://cloud.maptiler.com/account/switch?account_id=a8ee7342-ffd3-45a7-b7c3-1b50050b033d). Ask your teamleader or PO for an access. Please, mark all production datasets with label **PRODUCTION** and please write description to dataset/map with link where it is used for later.

# Where to get key for samples
Please use now just one key: `ikPbJwwEEbaMHCvgAxpQ`. We will replace it globally later. The key is under **MapTiler Web** account, so it has access to all uploaded sample data.
